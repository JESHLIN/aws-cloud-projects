To create an image labeling system using AWS services, we can use AWS Rekognition. AWS rekognition is a powerful service to find objects, people, text, scenes in images and videos using ML. Below are the general steps to set up an image labeling system:
1. Set Up AWS Rekognition:
   Create an S3 Bucket for labelling images. Select an image with multiple objects to showcase the capabilities of labelling. Click on "Add File" to upload the image. Ensure the IAM role has the necessary permissions to access S3 and use Rekognition.
